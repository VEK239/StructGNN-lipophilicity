## Changes in source code

### Earle stopping

We’ve changed train_base.py and arguments.py in source code to  add

### R2 score

We’ve also changed train_utils.py to add R2-score calculation. 

### Experiments directory

A small notebook demonstrating train/valid RMSE for best model’s predictions.

### Symmetry features were added

Adding two atomic and one path feature improved symmetric molecules prediction a little bit.
